This workflow prompts you to either select a photo or take one with the camera, then uses it to make an appropriate API request for Microsoft's [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/). The detected text is returned back and displayed as plain text that can be easily shared or copied to the clipboard.

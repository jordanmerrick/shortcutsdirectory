You can submit workflows in two ways:

- Creating an issue on GitHub
- Creating a pull request

### Creating an issue on Github

If you're familiar with Git, you can fork this repository and create a PR containing a workflow you wish to add. To export a workflow, open the Share Sheet and select **Share as File**.

You can submit workflows in two ways:

- Creating an issue on GitHub
- submitting a pull request

### Creating an issue on Github

The easiest way to submit a workflow is to create a new issue on GitHub. A GitHub account is required. Follow the issue template and provide:

- Workflow name
- A description
- Link to the workflow at **workflow.is**

### Submitting a pull request

If you're familiar with Git, you can fork this repository and create a pull request containing the workflow you wish to add. 

Pull requests should include:

- The **.wflow** workflow file
- Edits to the README to add the workflow to the list

To export a workflow, open the Share Sheet and select **Share as File**. When editing the README, make sure to place your workflow in alphabetical order and include a short description.

# Archive Screenshots

Submitted by: [@jordanmerrick](https://github.com/jordanmerrick)

Saves a copy of all screenshots stored in Photos to iCloud Drive. Screenshots are separated and organized into folders based upon creation date (e.g., 2017-01-01). I created this workflow as I take a lot of screenshots that I would rather store somewhere other than my Photos library. With this, I can archive all the screenshots to iCloud Drive and then delete them from the library.

Make use of Workflowâ€™s IFTTT integration and [this recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/428317-phoney-trigger-a-fake-phone-call-with-workflow) to call your phone after a specified amount of time. Handy for when you need to get out of an awkward situation!

This workflow can be run directly from an Apple Watch, or the Today Widget.

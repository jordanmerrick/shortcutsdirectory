Upload and organize screenshots of your iOS home screen on Dropbox. The workflow makes use of the “Wait to Return” action. After starting the workflow, exit to the home screen and take a screenshot, then return to Notification Center to continue. You can optionally tweet a photo of your latest home screen.

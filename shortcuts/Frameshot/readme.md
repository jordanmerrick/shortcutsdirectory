# Frameshot
    
Submitted by: [@melangue](https://github.com/melangue)

This workflow allows you to easily create a screenshot inside iOS devices frames.  
Run in it, choose pictures and the color of the device - it'll do the rest automatically and save the result to your Camera Roll.  
Both horizontal and vertical screenshots are supported.

Supported devices:

- iPhone SE
- iPhone 7
- iPhone 7 Plus
- iPad
- iPad Pro 12,9"

You'll need empty device frames found in  `frameshot/` folder, otherwise it won't work.   
Upload it to your iCloud Drive `Workflow/` folder.

Inspired by Federico Vittici's workflow.

# Instagram User Galleries

This workflow creates a text file on iCloud of user-created Instagram IDs (usernames). It allows the user to pick an ID and display grids of each Instagram feed. Swipe down on each gridded gallery to load the next. It has a repeat set for 20 times (grids), but you can make it shorter or longer.

# Site Search

Submitted by: [@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Some sites donâ€™t offer a built-in search function, but many search engines support site searches. Using this action extension on a website you want to search, you can enter a search query and a new window will open that will perform a site search using the search engine of your choice, specified in the workflow.

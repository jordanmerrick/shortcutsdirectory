# Call With Skype

Submitted by: [@bodgelife](https://github.com/bodgelife)

This workflow calls a phone number with Skype. It was created as a faster alternative to the Skype appâ€™s UI. It can accept phone numbers from a share sheet, the clipboard, or user input, depending on context.

The workflow has been tested with Skype version 6.35.1.

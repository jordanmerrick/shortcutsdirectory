Submitted by: [Jordan Merrick](https://www.jordanmerrick.com)

Retrieves a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Selecting a currency returns the current USD value, along with the percentage change from 24 hours ago.

The workflow can be run as normal, from the Today Widget, or directly on Apple Watch.

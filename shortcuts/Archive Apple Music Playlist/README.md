# Archive Playlist

Submitted by: [@wkillerud](https://github.com/wkillerud)

Lets you easily create an archive of Apples weekly mixes, such as your Favorites Mix. Create a playlist to act as an archive and answer the import questions, then run weekly.

Inspired by the [Spotify IFTTT applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/NFRkZeJu-automatically-create-a-discover-weekly-archive).

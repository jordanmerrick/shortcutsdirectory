# Waking Heart Rate Log

Submitted by: [@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

This workflow shows you measured heart rate values for the last 24 hrs. It allows you to select the waking heart rate then appends that date/value pair as well as the days average heart rate/Standard Deviation to a text file on either iCloud Drive or Dropbox (configurable in Workflow). It uses this data to update a graph which is also saved. 

As the Apple Watch does not pair with the phone in real time, it is better to run this workflow later in the day. It is also the reason I cannot just run the workflow from the watch when you wake up and sync the last heart rate (it hasnâ€™t synced to phone).

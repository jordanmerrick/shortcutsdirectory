An action extension that accepts an image and temporarily stores it in your Dropbox folder. A public URL for the image is created and used as a TinEye search. Once you've seen the results, the workflow deletes the file from Dropbox.

An action extension that accepts URLs. It gets the content of the URL, finds all images over 300px wide, and presents them all in a list for selection. The rest of the workflow is then the same as TinEye Image.

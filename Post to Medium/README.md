# Post to Medium

Submitted by: [@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

This workflow, used as an action extension with any Markdown-formatted text, uses [this IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/478555-create-a-medium-post-using-workflow) to create a published post on Medium. The workflow prompts for a title, tags, and canonical URL (if required) during the process before it's published. If you prefer, you can edit the recipe so that the post is unlisted or also added to a publication.

If you edit the recipe to have IFTTT create a draft post instead, tags are not included and need to be added when you edit the draft.

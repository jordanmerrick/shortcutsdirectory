# Workflow Directory

This repository contains user-submitted workflows for [Workflow for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l64N).

## Downloading workflows

You can quickly clone the repository using an app like [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-powerful-git-client/id896694807?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l64N) (one of my favorite iOS apps). You don't need to be familiar with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) to do this or even have a GitHub account.

## Submitting workflows

You can submit workflows in two ways:

- Creating an issue on GitHub
- submitting a pull request

### Creating an issue on Github

The easiest way to submit a workflow is to create a new issue on GitHub. A GitHub account is required. Follow the issue template and provide:

- Workflow name
- A description
- Link to the workflow at **workflow.is**

### Submitting a pull request

If you're familiar with Git, you can fork this repository and create a pull request containing the workflow you wish to add. 

Pull requests should include:

- The **.wflow** workflow file
- Edits to the README to add the workflow to the list

To export a workflow, open the Share Sheet and select **Share as File**. When editing the README, make sure to place your workflow in alphabetical order and include a short description.

## Create Gist

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

This action extension workflow accepts files of any type (though they must be text-based) and creates a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jordanmerrick/9f619c0aaffffd5bb46fad71e73e1477) using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/).

You need to create a GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) before you can use this workflow. GitHub allows you to create multiple access tokens with different permissions. For the purpose of this workflow, I recommend creating a token that can only be used to work with gists. 

## Create a Chart

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

This workflow will create one of four different charts with information you provide. Chart generation isn’t handled by Workflow, as there is no native graphing functionality, but instead makes use of [ChartGo](http://chartgo.com/), a free online chart generator that generates a chart using a query string provided in a URL.

## Daily Health Report

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Using health data, this workflow will display an alert showing your total step count, flights climbed, walking + running distance and calories logged for the day. Your most recent weight is also included. 

## Days Between

Must be run from Today widget.

## My Health Today

[@jneug](https://twitter.com/jneug)

This workflow will help you quickly enter data into the Health app. There are many apps out there that specialize in a few data types and are great to get specific evaluations of your data, but this workflow is accessible from the Today view.

It can be configured to your needs, to show you only those data types you frequently update and a selection of values to enter with the tab of a button. To do this, the workflow has to be configured with a JSON dictionary of a specific form. If you know how JSON works, then just have a look at the provided example and write your own. If you don know what JSON is, then refer to the [Health Item Generator](/workflows/health-item-generator) workflow, for (nearly) fully automated config generation. 

**Important Note**: To use this workflow you need to give Workflows access to Health App. To do so, create a new workflow and add a “Log Health Sample” action. Select the type you want to use and tab “Grant Access”. Allow read and write access on the popup and tab allow at the top. Do this for every health type you want to access via Workflows.

## Named Workflow Link Creator

## Record Voice Memo

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Record a voice memo and save it to Dropbox directly from your Apple Watch. 

## RunKeeper Import

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Imports the running workout data from an exported RunKeeper data CSV file into Health, logging with each the date and time, duration, distance and calories burned.

Export your data from RunKeeper and place the CSV file somewhere in Dropbox (or modify the workflow if you want to access this file in another way). Exporting your data can be done in your RunKeeper Settings, where you’ll need to specify a date range. If you’re still going to be using RunKeeper and continuing to workouts to Health, I suggest looking through your Health workout history to see exactly when RunKeeper started logging runs to Health and using this as the end date, otherwise you’ll end up with duplicate workouts, logged by RunKeeper and Workflow.

The exported data will contain a number of files, but this workflow just uses the **cardioActivities.csv** file. Confirm that the column headers in the file are as follows:

  * **Date**
  * **Type**
  * Route Name
  * **Distance**
  * **Duration**
  * Average Pace
  * Average Speed
  * **Calories Burned**
  * Climb
  * Average Heart Rate
  * Notes
  * GPX File

The list items in bold represents the data that this workflow will use.

Edit the workflow and updated the “Log Workout” action to specify the unit of distance you need to use. By default, it’s in Kilometers, so if all your workout data is in Miles, change this before continuing.

Run the workflow, choose “Test” mode and select the CSV file in Dropbox that was exported from RunKeeper. The workflow will begin and may take about 10–30 seconds to run, depending on how much historic data you have.

Provided Workflow doesn’t display any errors, you should see Workflow output all of your runs as a list in a basic text format with all of our workout data (note that this workflow converts any workout durations into seconds). If you’re happy that this all looks correct, re-run the workflow in “Live” mode.

## SOS

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Quickly send out an SOS message using your iPhone’s LED light. 

When running the workflow, you’ll be prompted for how many times you want an SOS message to be repeated.

## Save App Store Assets

Quickly send an article, a webpage or a text as a PDF to Kindle with this in-app workflow.

## Share YouTube at Specified Time

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Since the YouTube iOS app doesn’t support sharing at a specific time, this workflow lets you specify the time (minutes and seconds) that a YouTube video will start playing from, and creates the link to share.

## Simple Watermark

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Copies the specified text to the clipboard, then uses the Edit Image action to add text. The text in the clipboard then needs to be pasted into the text field. 

## Site Search

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

## Waking Heart Rate Log

[@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

This workflow shows you measured heart rate values for the last 24 hrs. It allows you to select the waking heart rate then appends that date/value pair as well as the days average heart rate/Standard Deviation to a text file on either iCloud Drive or Dropbox (configurable in Workflow). It uses this data to update a graph which is also saved. 

As the Apple Watch does not pair with the phone in real time, it is better to run this workflow later in the day. It is also the reason I cannot just run the workflow from the watch when you wake up and sync the last heart rate (it hasn’t synced to phone).

## Zip/Unzip

[@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

Zip and unzip files either via app extension or via file selection dialog.

# Workflow Directory

This repository contains user-submitted workflows for [Workflow for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l64N).

## Downloading workflows

You can quickly clone the repository using an app like [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-powerful-git-client/id896694807?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l64N) (one of my favorite iOS apps). You don't need to be familiar with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) to do this or even have a GitHub account.

## Create Gist

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

This action extension workflow accepts files of any type (though they must be text-based) and creates a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jordanmerrick/9f619c0aaffffd5bb46fad71e73e1477) using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/).

You need to create a GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) before you can use this workflow. GitHub allows you to create multiple access tokens with different permissions. For the purpose of this workflow, I recommend creating a token that can only be used to work with gists. 

## Create a Chart

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

This workflow will create one of four different charts with information you provide. Chart generation isn’t handled by Workflow, as there is no native graphing functionality, but instead makes use of [ChartGo](http://chartgo.com/), a free online chart generator that generates a chart using a query string provided in a URL.

## Daily Health Report

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Using health data, this workflow will display an alert showing your total step count, flights climbed, walking + running distance and calories logged for the day. Your most recent weight is also included. 

## Days Between

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Quickly calculate the total number of days between two specific dates on your Apple Watch or as a normal workflow. Select a start date and end date (it doesn’t matter what order) using the date pickers (default date is today) and the workflow will display a message with the total number of days between.

## Delete Latest Screenshots

## Log Calories by Scanning a Barcode

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Using information from the [Nutritionix](http://www.nutritionix.com/) USDA common foods database, you can scan a barcode on almost any US grocery item to find its calories and log them to Health. You can alter the serving size accordingly, which will adjust the calories calculated before logging them to Health. If no information can be found, the workflow will then ask you if you’d like to manually enter calorie information instead.

## Log Nutrient(s)

[@deanlyoung](https://twitter.com/deanlyoung)

Scan a grocery item’s barcode and log all available nutrient information from the Nutritionix database in Health.

You’ll need to register for a free API key at [Nutritionix](http://www.nutritionix.com/), which is limited to 20 UPC lookups a day.

## Make Workflow Link

[@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

This workflow makes a link to other workflows. It is most useful to run a workflow (Receiver) from from another workflow (Sender). This technique allows components of workflows to reused as the equivalent to a subroutine. 

## Manually Log Calories

This is a variant of the [Log Calories](http://workflow.directory/post/129863718588/log-calories) workflow and isn’t suitable for the Apple Watch as it can only access health data that’s been logged using this workflow.

## Monthly Weight Chart

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Based upon the [Create a Chart](https://workflow.directory/workflows/create-a-chart) workflow, create a chart of your weight data based upon a specified number of months (at least two). 

## Monthly Weight Report

Using Health data, this workflow compares your most recent weight to that of 30 days ago and displays the results in an alert. You can specify the unit of measurement or set this within the workflow.

## More Workflows

[@Ostarc](https://twitter.com/Ostarc)

Increase the number of available workflows in the Today Widget to 18. By adding an asterisk to the name of additional workflows, this workflow will list them for access from within the Today Widget. 

## Morse Code Decoder

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Convert a morse code string back into alphanumeric characters. You can combine this with the [Morse Code Encoder](/workflows/morse-code-encoder) workflow to encode and decode morse code messages in Workflow.

## Multitasking

[@tedsvo](https://twitter.com/tedsvo)

This uses an undocumented URL scheme to launch the gestures setting pane on iPad. Great for disabling multitasking gestures that otherwise interfere with palm rejection in writing apps.

Must be run from Today widget.

## My Health Today

[@jneug](https://twitter.com/jneug)

This workflow will help you quickly enter data into the Health app. There are many apps out there that specialize in a few data types and are great to get specific evaluations of your data, but this workflow is accessible from the Today view.

It can be configured to your needs, to show you only those data types you frequently update and a selection of values to enter with the tab of a button. To do this, the workflow has to be configured with a JSON dictionary of a specific form. If you know how JSON works, then just have a look at the provided example and write your own. If you don know what JSON is, then refer to the [Health Item Generator](/workflows/health-item-generator) workflow, for (nearly) fully automated config generation. 

**Important Note**: To use this workflow you need to give Workflows access to Health App. To do so, create a new workflow and add a “Log Health Sample” action. Select the type you want to use and tab “Grant Access”. Allow read and write access on the popup and tab allow at the top. Do this for every health type you want to access via Workflows.

## Named Workflow Link Creator

[@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

Takes a Workflow Link (obtained by cog icon > Share Workflow > Copy Link) and then converts it into the stylized HTML tag version of link ready for posting.

## Overlay Watermark

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Using an image as a watermark, this workflow overlays it to a specific corner of the workflow, proportional to the size of the image being watermarked.

## Personal Podcast Feed

## Record Voice Memo

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Record a voice memo and save it to Dropbox directly from your Apple Watch. 

## RunKeeper Import

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Imports the running workout data from an exported RunKeeper data CSV file into Health, logging with each the date and time, duration, distance and calories burned.

Export your data from RunKeeper and place the CSV file somewhere in Dropbox (or modify the workflow if you want to access this file in another way). Exporting your data can be done in your RunKeeper Settings, where you’ll need to specify a date range. If you’re still going to be using RunKeeper and continuing to workouts to Health, I suggest looking through your Health workout history to see exactly when RunKeeper started logging runs to Health and using this as the end date, otherwise you’ll end up with duplicate workouts, logged by RunKeeper and Workflow.

The exported data will contain a number of files, but this workflow just uses the **cardioActivities.csv** file. Confirm that the column headers in the file are as follows:

  * **Date**
  * **Type**
  * Route Name
  * **Distance**
  * **Duration**
  * Average Pace
  * Average Speed
  * **Calories Burned**
  * Climb
  * Average Heart Rate
  * Notes
  * GPX File

The list items in bold represents the data that this workflow will use.

Edit the workflow and updated the “Log Workout” action to specify the unit of distance you need to use. By default, it’s in Kilometers, so if all your workout data is in Miles, change this before continuing.

Run the workflow, choose “Test” mode and select the CSV file in Dropbox that was exported from RunKeeper. The workflow will begin and may take about 10–30 seconds to run, depending on how much historic data you have.

Provided Workflow doesn’t display any errors, you should see Workflow output all of your runs as a list in a basic text format with all of our workout data (note that this workflow converts any workout durations into seconds). If you’re happy that this all looks correct, re-run the workflow in “Live” mode.

## SOS

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Quickly send out an SOS message using your iPhone’s LED light. 

When running the workflow, you’ll be prompted for how many times you want an SOS message to be repeated.

## Save App Store Assets

Quickly send an article, a webpage or a text as a PDF to Kindle with this in-app workflow.

## Share YouTube at Specified Time

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Since the YouTube iOS app doesn’t support sharing at a specific time, this workflow lets you specify the time (minutes and seconds) that a YouTube video will start playing from, and creates the link to share.

## Simple Watermark

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Copies the specified text to the clipboard, then uses the Edit Image action to add text. The text in the clipboard then needs to be pasted into the text field. 

## Site Search

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Some sites don’t offer a built-in search function, but many search engines support site searches. Using this action extension on a website you want to search, you can enter a search query and a new window will open that will perform a site search using the search engine of your choice, specified in the workflow.

## Static Site Generator

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Using text files as the basis for its content, generate an entire website containing a blog and pages, complete with an RSS feed, that you can upload to your web host.

## Submit to Workflow Directory

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Use this to submit your own workflows directly within the app. Copy the URL of the workflow you want to share, then run this workflow to submit it to Workflow Directory. All of the workflow’s information will be automatically collected. 

The first action should be a comment, which is used as the description for the workflow. Use only a brief description, and place any in-depth information (if necessary) in a separate comment action. See the [FAQ](/faq) for more information. 

## Tide Table

## View Twitter Profile in Tweetbot or Twitterrific

[@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Open a user’s profile using on a Twitter.com link in either Tweetbot or Twitterrific.

## Waking Heart Rate Log

[@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

This workflow shows you measured heart rate values for the last 24 hrs. It allows you to select the waking heart rate then appends that date/value pair as well as the days average heart rate/Standard Deviation to a text file on either iCloud Drive or Dropbox (configurable in Workflow). It uses this data to update a graph which is also saved. 

As the Apple Watch does not pair with the phone in real time, it is better to run this workflow later in the day. It is also the reason I cannot just run the workflow from the watch when you wake up and sync the last heart rate (it hasn’t synced to phone).

## Zip/Unzip

[@cycle4passion](https://twitter.com/cycle4passion)

Zip and unzip files either via app extension or via file selection dialog.

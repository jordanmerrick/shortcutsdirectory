# Shortcuts Directory

This repository contains user-submitted shortcuts for [Shortcuts for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id915249334?at=10l64N).

All shortcuts are saved as **.shortcut** files and located in the **shortcuts/** directory so that they are available without needing an iCloud link. Each shortcut includes a README with information about it. Older workflows are saved as **.wflow** files and are compatible with Shortcuts.

Submitted by: [@melangue](https://github.com/melangue)

There is no wishlist functionality in iOS 11's AppStore.  
This workflow adds it back and then some.

On first run it will create a text file on your iCloud Drive which will act as the database of your apps.

You can change the region and currency in the first dictionary action.

## Features
- Show Apps - Presents a list of your apps and opens chosen app in AppStore
- Add Apps - You can add apps straight from AppStore by using `Share sheet / Run Workflow` action, or just copy the link to your clipboard
- Remove App - Self explanatory
- Check Prices - Compare prices of all apps in your list and see if any of them is currently on sale

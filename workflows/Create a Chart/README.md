# Create a Chart

Submitted by: [@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

This workflow will create one of four different charts with information you provide. Chart generation isnâ€™t handled by Workflow, as there is no native graphing functionality, but instead makes use of [ChartGo](http://chartgo.com/), a free online chart generator that generates a chart using a query string provided in a URL.

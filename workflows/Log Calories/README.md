# Log Calories by Scanning a Barcode

Submitted by: [@jordanmerrick](https://twitter.com/jordanmerrick)

Using information from the [Nutritionix](http://www.nutritionix.com/) USDA common foods database, you can scan a barcode on almost any US grocery item to find its calories and log them to Health. You can alter the serving size accordingly, which will adjust the calories calculated before logging them to Health. If no information can be found, the workflow will then ask you if youâ€™d like to manually enter calorie information instead.
